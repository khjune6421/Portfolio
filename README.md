Console based fortress-like game

A console-based fortress-like game I've made with 권용범 and 황재하

## Key Features I've implemented

parabola system for artillery

- projectile motion calculations
- random wind direction and strength
- hit detection

## Things that could be improved

- delta time based projectile calculations
- better class structure
- and so much more...

## Trivia

This was my first game project ever, and there is many rooms for improvement.
